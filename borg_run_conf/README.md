# Borg Run Conf

This is simply an interface for borg that makes it a bit easier to use and set for scheduled tasks. The conf is configured with a sample conf that is easy to reconfigure and provides extra abilities for postflight scripts to run and email a log of successes or failures.


This project originated as part of my Notes to self, but after some development I decided to separate these into separate projects and use submodules to keep them together
