# Scripts Readme

This is an aggregation of scripts I developed in coordination with my [notes to self](https://github.com/mredig/Notes-to-Self). This can be used independent of the notes and vice versa.

### load dependencies
Right now, this section is no more than scratch notes:

One or some combination of these should get the scripts to load with all their dependencies

* `git submodule update --init --recursive`
* `git submodule update --recursive`
* `git clone --recursive`
